#Live Editing with Markdown

ASPDoc uses a high performance code editor **Ace Editor** and a built for speed markdown parser **Marked** and a beautiful CSS and Javascript
framework called **Semantic UI**. The right panel is the live preview window which is updated as you start writing your markdown.

For your assistance, we have an inbuilt [media manager](media-manager) which helps you create directories and upload media files 
and insert the media directly to the editor.
