#Arbitary URLs in ASPDoc.net

While creating a page in ASPDoc.net, you can provide a link to the URL that does not exists. Upon visiting the URL that does not exist,
you can create the page there.

Let's say you are creating a page called "Foo's Documentation", like shown in this image:

![../Site/Media/Documentation/foos-documentation.png](../Site/Media/Documentation/foos-documentation.png)

In this page, we have a markdown link which points to a url "about-bar" which does not exist yet. When you click the link on the right side,
the browser will nagivate to that page, which looks like this:

![../Site/Media/Documentation/about-bar.png](../Site/Media/Documentation/about-bar.png)

You can now create this page by writing some contents and clicking "Save Document".
