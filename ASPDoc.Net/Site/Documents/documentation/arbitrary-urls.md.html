<h1 id="arbitary-urls-in-aspdoc-net">Arbitary URLs in ASPDoc.net</h1>
<p>While creating a page in ASPDoc.net, you can provide a link to the URL that does not exists. Upon visiting the URL that does not exist,
you can create the page there.</p>
<p>Let's say you are creating a page called "Foo's Documentation", like shown in this image:</p>
<p><img src="../Site/Media/Documentation/foos-documentation.png" alt="../Site/Media/Documentation/foos-documentation.png"></p>
<p>In this page, we have a markdown link which points to a url "about-bar" which does not exist yet. When you click the link on the right side,
the browser will nagivate to that page, which looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="../Site/Media/Documentation/about-bar.png" alt="../Site/Media/Documentation/about-bar.png"></p>
<p>You can now create this page by writing some contents and clicking "Save Document".</p>
